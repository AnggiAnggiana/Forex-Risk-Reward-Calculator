FOREX RISK & REWARD RATIO CALCULATOR
There are some features hasn't added yet:
1. Setting lots according to nominal balance (lot created based on the balance * risk percent)
2. Added "nett profit" and "nett loss" show result (calculate from balance * lot)

HOW TO USE:
1. Type your balance(money)
2. Choose one of the pair choices
3. Type the number for each form (open price, stop loss, take profit, and risk)
4. Click "calculate" button to show the result of the calculation
5. Click "add form" if you want to add more form

There is still bug on this project:
1. When you add the second form and the rest of them, then you want show the result of the calculation by clicking the "Calculate" button. It will appear on the screen. However, when you revise the numbers on the second form and the subsequent ones, and then try to display the result with the "Calculate" button, the result on the screen doesn't change.
